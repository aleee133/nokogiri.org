Security and Vulnerability Reporting \u00b6 Please report vulnerabilities at https://hackerone.com/nokogiri Full information and description of our security policy is in SECURITY.md Synopsis \u00b6 Nokogiri is a large library, but here is example usage for parsing and examining a document: #! /usr/bin/env ruby require 'nokogiri' require 'open-uri' # Fetch and parse HTML document doc = Nokogiri :: HTML ( URI . open ( 'https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html' )) puts \"### Search for nodes by css\" doc . css ( 'nav ul.menu li a' , 'article h2' ) . each do | link | puts link . content end puts \"### Search for nodes by xpath\" doc . xpath ( '//nav//ul//li/a' , '//article//h2' ) . each do | link | puts link . content end puts \"### Or mix and match.\" doc . search ( 'nav ul.menu li a' , '//article//h2' ) . each do | link | puts link . content end Requirements \u00b6 Ruby 2.5.0 or higher, including any development packages necessary to compile native extensions. In Nokogiri 1.6.0 and later libxml2 and libxslt are bundled with the gem, but if you want to use the system versions: First, check out the long list of fixes and changes between releases before deciding to use any version older than is bundled with Nokogiri. At install time, set the environment variable NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES or else use the --use-system-libraries argument. (See https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html#install-with-system-libraries for specifics.) libxml2 >=2.6.21 with iconv support (libxml2-dev/-devel is also required) libxslt, built with and supported by the given libxml2 (libxslt-dev/-devel is also required) Encoding \u00b6 Strings are always stored as UTF-8 internally. Methods that return text values will always return UTF-8 encoded strings. Methods that return a string containing markup (like to_xml , to_html and inner_html ) will return a string encoded like the source document. WARNING Some documents declare one encoding, but actually use a different one. In these cases, which encoding should the parser choose? Data is just a stream of bytes. Humans add meaning to that stream. Any particular set of bytes could be valid characters in multiple encodings, so detecting encoding with 100% accuracy is not possible. libxml2 does its best, but it can't be right all the time. If you want Nokogiri to handle the document encoding properly, your best bet is to explicitly set the encoding. Here is an example of explicitly setting the encoding to EUC-JP on the parser: doc = Nokogiri .

We bump Major.Minor.Patch versions following this guidance: Major : (we've never done this) Significant backwards-incompatible changes to the public API that would require rewriting existing application code. Some examples of backwards-incompatible changes we might someday consider for a Major release are at ROADMAP.md . Minor : Features and bugfixes. Updating packaged libraries for non-security-related reasons. Dropping support for EOLed Ruby versions. Some folks find this objectionable , but SemVer says this is OK if the public API hasn't changed . Backwards-incompatible changes to internal or private methods and constants. These are detailed in the \"Changes\" section of each changelog entry. Patch : Bugfixes. Security updates. Updating packaged libraries for security-related reasons. Unreleased (will be v1.11.0) \u00b6 Latest is v1.11.0.rc4 (2020-12-29). To try out release candidates, use gem install --prerelease or gem install nokogiri -v1.11.0.rc4 If you're using bundler, try updating your Gemfile with: gem \"nokogiri\" , \"~> 1.11.0.rc4\" ` Notes \u00b6 Faster, more reliable installation: Native Gems for Linux and OSX/Darwin \u00b6 \"Native gems\" contain pre-compiled libraries for a specific machine architecture. On supported platforms, this removes the need for compiling the C extension and the packaged libraries. This results in much faster installation and more reliable installation , which as you probably know are the biggest headaches for Nokogiri users. We've been shipping native Windows gems since 2009, but starting in v1.11.0 we are also shipping native gems for these platforms: Linux: x86-linux and x86_64-linux -- including musl platforms like alpine OSX/Darwin: x86_64-darwin We'd appreciate your thoughts and feedback on this work at #2075 . Dependencies \u00b6 Ruby \u00b6 This release introduces support for Ruby 2.7 and 3.0 in the precompiled native gems. This release ends support for: Ruby 2.3, for which official support ended on 2019-03-31 [ #1886 ] (Thanks @ashmaroli !) Ruby 2.4, for which official support ended on 2020-04-05 JRuby 9.1, which is the Ruby 2.3-compatible release. Gems \u00b6 Explicitly add racc as a runtime dependency. [ #1988 ] (Thanks, @voxik !) [MRI] Upgrade mini_portile2 dependency from ~> 2.4.0 to ~> 2.5.0 [ #2005 ] (Thanks, @alejandroperea !) Security \u00b6 See note below about CVE-2020-26247 in the \"Changed\" subsection entitled \"XML::Schema parsing treats input as untrusted by default\". Added \u00b6 Add Node methods for manipulating \"keyword attributes\" (for example, class and rel ): #kwattr_values , #kwattr_add , #kwattr_append , and #kwattr_remove . [ #2000 ] Add support for CSS queries a:has(> b) , a:has(~ b) , and a:has(+ b) . [ #688 ] (Thanks, @jonathanhefner !) Add Node#value? to better match expected semantics of a Hash-like object. [ #1838 , #1840 ] (Thanks, @MatzFan !) [CRuby] Add Nokogiri::XML::Node#line= for use by downstream libs like nokogumbo. [ #1918 ] (Thanks, @stevecheckoway !) Performance \u00b6 [CRuby] The CSS ~= operator and class selector . are about 2x faster. [ #2137 , #2135 ] [CRuby] Patch libxml2 to call strlen from xmlStrlen rather than the naive implementation, because strlen is generally optimized for the architecture. [ #2144 ] (Thanks, @ilyazub !) Improve performance of some namespace operations. [ #1916 ] (Thanks, @ashmaroli !) Remove unnecessary array allocations from Node serialization methods [ #1911 ] (Thanks, @ashmaroli !) Avoid creation of unnecessary zero-length String objects. [ #1970 ] (Thanks, @ashmaroli !) Always compile libxml2 and libxslt with '-O2' [ #2022 , #2100 ] (Thanks, @ilyazub !) [JRuby] Lots of code cleanup and performance improvements. [ #1934 ] (Thanks, @kares !) [CRuby] RelaxNG.from_document no longer leaks memory. [ #2114 ] Improved \u00b6 [CRuby] Handle incorrectly-closed HTML comments as WHATWG recommends for browsers. [ #2058 ] (Thanks to HackerOne user mayflower for reporting this!) {HTML,XML}::Document#parse now accept Pathname objects. Previously this worked only if the referenced file was less than 4096 bytes long; longer files resulted in undefined behavior because the read method would be repeatedly invoked. [ #1821 , #2110 ] (Thanks, @doriantaylor and @phokz !) [CRuby] Nokogumbo builds faster because it can now use header files provided by Nokogiri. [ #1788 ] (Thanks, @stevecheckoway !) Add frozen_string_literal: true magic comment to all lib files. [ #1745 ] (Thanks, @oniofchaos !) [JRuby] Clean up deprecated calls into JRuby. [ #2027 ] (Thanks, @headius !) Fixed \u00b6 HTML Parsing in \"strict\" mode (i.e., the RECOVER parse option not set) now correctly raises a XML::SyntaxError exception. Previously the value of the RECOVER bit was being ignored by CRuby and was misinterpreted by JRuby. [ #2130 ] The CSS ~= operator now correctly handles non-space whitespace in the class attribute. commit e45dedd The switch to turn off the CSS-to-XPath cache is now thread-local, rather than being shared mutable state. [ #1935 ] The Node methods add_previous_sibling , previous= , before , add_next_sibling , next= , after , replace , and swap now correctly use their parent as the context node for parsing markup. These methods now also raise a RuntimeError if they are called on a node with no parent. [ nokogumbo#160 ] [JRuby] XML::Schema XSD validation errors are captured in XML::Schema#errors . These errors were previously ignored. [JRuby] Standardize reading from IO like objects, including StringIO. [ #1888 , #1897 ] [JRuby] Fix how custom XPath function namespaces are inferred to be less naive. [ #1890 , #2148 ] [JRuby] Clarify exception message when custom XPath functions can't be resolved. [JRuby] Comparison of Node to Document with Node#<=> now matches CRuby/libxml2 behavior. [CRuby] Syntax errors are now correctly captured in Document#errors for short HTML documents. Previously the SAX parser used for encoding detection was clobbering libxml2's global error handler. [CRuby] Fixed installation on AIX with respect to vasprintf . [ #1908 ] [CRuby] On some platforms, avoid symbol name collision with glibc's canonicalize . [ #2105 ] [Windows Visual C++] Fixed compiler warnings and errors. [ #2061 , #2068 ] [CRuby] Fixed Nokogumbo integration which broke in the v1.11.0 release candidates. [ #1788 ] (Thanks, @stevecheckoway !) [JRuby] Fixed document encoding regression in v1.11.0 release candidates. [ #2080 , #2083 ] (Thanks, @thbar !) Removed \u00b6 The internal method Nokogiri::CSS::Parser.cache_on= has been removed. Use .set_cache if you need to muck with the cache internals. The class method Nokogiri::CSS::Parser.parse has been removed. This was originally deprecated in 2009 in 13db61b. Use Nokogiri::CSS.parse instead. Changed \u00b6 XML::Schema input is now \"untrusted\" by default \u00b6 Address CVE-2020-26247 . In Nokogiri versions <= 1.11.0.rc3, XML Schemas parsed by Nokogiri::XML::Schema were trusted by default, allowing external resources to be accessed over the network, potentially enabling XXE or SSRF attacks. This behavior is counter to the security policy intended by Nokogiri maintainers, which is to treat all input as untrusted by default whenever possible. Please note that this security fix was pushed into a new minor version, 1.11.x, rather than a patch release to the 1.10.x branch, because it is a breaking change for some schemas and the risk was assessed to be \"Low Severity\". More information and instructions for enabling \"trusted input\" behavior in v1.11.0.rc4 and later is available at the public advisory . HTML parser now obeys the strict or norecover parsing option \u00b6 (Also noted above in the \"Fixed\" section) HTML Parsing in \"strict\" mode (i.e., the RECOVER parse option not set) now correctly raises a XML::SyntaxError exception. Previously the value of the RECOVER bit was being ignored by CRuby and was misinterpreted by JRuby. If you're using the default parser options, you will be unaffected by this fix. If you're passing strict or norecover to your HTML parser call, you may be surprised to see that the parser now fails to recover and raises a XML::SyntaxError exception. Given the number of HTML documents on the internet that libxml2 would consider to be ill-formed, this is probably not what you want, and you can omit setting that parse option to restore the behavior that you have been relying upon. Apologies to anyone inconvenienced by this breaking bugfix being present in a minor release, but I felt it was appropriate to introduce this fix because it's straightforward to fix any code that has been relying on this buggy behavior. VersionInfo , the output of nokogiri -v , and related constants \u00b6 This release changes the metadata provided in Nokogiri::VersionInfo which also affects the output of nokogiri -v . Some related constants have also been changed. If you're using VersionInfo programmatically, or relying on constants related to underlying library versions, please read the detailed changes for Nokogiri::VersionInfo at #2139 and accept our apologies for the inconvenience. 1.10.10 / 2020-07-06 \u00b6 Features \u00b6 [MRI] Cross-built Windows gems now support Ruby 2.7 [ #2029 ]. Note that prior to this release, the v1.11.x prereleases provided this support. 1.10.9 / 2020-03-01 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 [MRI] Raise an exception when Nokogiri detects a specific libxml2 edge case involving blank Schema nodes wrapped by Ruby objects that would cause a segfault. Currently no fix is available upstream, so we're preventing a dangerous operation and informing users to code around it if possible. [ #1985 , #2001 ] [JRuby] Change NodeSet#to_a to return a RubyArray instead of Object, for compilation under JRuby 9.2.9 and later. [ #1968 , #1969 ] (Thanks, @headius !) 1.10.8 / 2020-02-10 \u00b6 Security \u00b6 [MRI] Pulled in upstream patch from libxml that addresses CVE-2020-7595. Full details are available in #1992 .

A command injection vulnerability in Nokogiri v1.10.3 and earlier allows commands to be executed in a subprocess by Ruby's Kernel.open method. Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file is being passed untrusted user input. This vulnerability appears in code generated by the Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical is used by Nokogiri to generate lexical scanner code for parsing CSS queries. The underlying vulnerability was addressed in Rexical v1.0.7 and Nokogiri upgraded to this version of Rexical in Nokogiri v1.10.4. This CVE's public notice is #1915 1.10.3 / 2019-04-22 \u00b6 Security \u00b6 [MRI] Pulled in upstream patch from libxslt that addresses CVE-2019-11068. Full details are available in #1892 .

Note that this document is broken into multiple sections, each of which describes the dependencies of a different \"platform release\" of Nokogiri. Default platform release (\"ruby\") Native Linux\u24c7 platform releases (\"x86_64-linux\" and \"arm64-linux\") Native Darwin (macOS\u24c7) platform releases (\"x86_64-darwin\" and \"arm64-darwin\") Native Windows\u24c7 platform releases (\"x86-mingw32\" and \"x64-mingw32\") Java\u24c7 (JRuby) platform release (\"java\") Appendix: Dependencies' License Texts libxml2 libxslt zlib libiconv isorelax jing nekodtd nekohtml xalan xerces xml-apis It's encouraged for anyone consuming this file via license-tracking software to understand which gem file you're downloading and using, so as not to misinterpret the contents of this file and the licenses of the software being distributed. You can double-check the dependencies in your gem file by examining the output of nokogiri -v after installation, which will emit the complete set of libraries in use (for versions >= 1.11.0.rc4 ). In particular, I'm sure somebody's lawyer, somewhere, is going to freak out that the LGPL appears in this file; and so I'd like to take special note that the dependency covered by LGPL, libiconv , is only being redistributed in the native Windows and native Darwin platform releases. It's not present in default, Java\u24c7, or native Linux\u24c7 releases. Default platform release (\"ruby\") \u00b6 The default platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form: libxml2 libxslt This distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have the value \"ruby\" for its \"platform\" attribute. Native Linux\u24c7 platform releases (\"x86_64-linux\" and \"arm64-linux\") \u00b6 The native Linux\u24c7 platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form: libxml2 libxslt zlib This distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have a value similar to \"x86_64-linux\" or \"x86-linux\" for its \"platform.cpu\" attribute. Native Darwin (macOS\u24c7) platform releases (\"x86_64-darwin\" and \"arm64-darwin\") \u00b6 The native Darwin platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form: libxml2 libxslt zlib libiconv This distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have a value similar to \"x86_64-darwin\" or \"arm64-darwin\" for its \"platform.cpu\" attribute. Darwin is also known more familiarly as \"OSX\" or \"macOS\u24c7\" and is the operating system for many Apple\u24c7 computers. Native Windows\u24c7 platform releases (\"x86-mingw32\" and \"x64-mingw32\") \u00b6 The native Windows\u24c7 platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form: libxml2 libxslt zlib libiconv This distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have a value similar to \"x64-mingw32\" or \"x86-mingw32\" for its \"platform.cpu\" attribute. Java\u24c7 (JRuby) platform release (\"java\") \u00b6 The Java platform release distributes the following dependencies as compiled jar files: isorelax jing nekodtd nekohtml xalan xerces xml-apis This distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have the value \"java\" for its \"platform.os\" attribute.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license. The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such. Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better. However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library. Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one. GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Library General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker. <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of Vice That's all there is to it! isorelax \u00b6 MIT http://iso-relax.sourceforge.net/ Copyright (c) 2001-2002, SourceForge ISO-RELAX Project (ASAMI Tomoharu, Daisuke Okajima, Kohsuke Kawaguchi, and MURATA Makoto) Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license. The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such. Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better. However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library. Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one. GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Library General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary.

By default, installation of Nokogiri will use these copies. Alternatively, you may install using your operating system's built-in libraries or other custom versions of these libraries. This document also helps with common problems we've heard. If you have an issue not discussed here, please open an issue . For earlier versions of Nokogiri, find instructions in the git history for this document . For other platforms, please send pull requests to sparklemotion/nokogiri.org-tutorials . Install with included libraries (RECOMMENDED) \u00b6 Ubuntu / Debian \u00b6 Install Nokogiri on a brand new Ubuntu system with these commands: sudo apt-get install build-essential patch ruby-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev gem install nokogiri Note for RVM users: you may require libgmp , consider running sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev . FreeBSD / OpenBSD >= 6.2 \u00b6 Install Nokogiri on a brand new FreeBSD system with these commands: gem install nokogiri OpenBSD < 6.2 \u00b6 Use gcc from ports in order to compile the included libraries: pkg_add -v gcc gem install nokogiri Windows \u00b6 Precompiled Gems \u00b6 If you're using RubyInstaller to install Ruby, then you can install Nokogiri's pre-compiled gem to avoid having to install a compiler toolchain: gem install nokogiri Note that gem will download and use a version of the gem appropriate for your system and architecture (e.g., x64-mingw32 , x86-mingw32 , etc.). Compiling From Source \u00b6 Nokogiri source gems can also be compiled and installed using RubyInstaller plus Devkit. This might be necessary if the binary gem doesn't work with your ruby version. (However, if a brand new Ruby version has just come out, give the maintainers a week or so to cut a compatible version of the gem!) Install Nokogiri by compiling the vendored libxml/libxslt libraries: gem install nokogiri --platform = ruby Alternatively, install Nokogiri by linking to MSYS2 system libraries: ridk exec pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libxslt gem install nokogiri --platform = ruby -- --use-system-libraries Fedora, Red Hat, and CentOS \u00b6 Install Nokogiri on a brand new Fedora, Red Hat, or CentOS system with these commands: dnf install -y make gcc rpm-build ruby-devel zlib-devel gem install nokogiri Alternatively, you may install the appropriate epel-release and get the Nokogiri package from EPEL using: sudo dnf install -y rubygem-nokogiri GNU Guix \u00b6 Install on any Linux distribution using GNU Guix , a reproducible binary software package management and distribution system. Use this command: guix package -i ruby-nokogiri Note: source code is available here . A short description of how Nokogiri was packaged can be found here . Ruby on Alpine Linux (Docker) \u00b6 The official ruby-alpine Docker images are stripped of their development tools to minimize size. To install nokogiri (or other gems with native extensions) you'll need to install build tools again via the build-base meta-package (which includes gcc and other necessities). FROM ruby:2.6-alpine RUN apk add --no-cache build-base RUN gem install nokogiri TermUX \u00b6 Although TermUX isn't fully supported right now, some people have reported success getting Nokogiri installed on it by running these commands: pkg install ruby clang make pkg-config libxslt gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries macOS \u00b6 First, make sure you have the latest version of RubyGems and xcode commandline tools: gem update --system xcode-select --install # Then agree to the terms, even if you have done this before! Agree to the Xcode license: sudo xcodebuild -license Then install nokogiri: gem install nokogiri This is verified working on maxOS 10.9 w/ Xcode's clang compiler. (Many thanks to @allaire and others for helping!) xcode-select errors with a 'network problem' \u00b6 If, you see this dialog when you run the above commands: Then run this command to turn off forced-authentication with Apple Software Update: sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL Error Message About Undeclared Identifier LZMA_OK \u00b6 A more recent error mentions an undeclared identifier LZMA_OK : xmlIO.c:1450:52: error: use of undeclared identifier 'LZMA_OK' ret = (__libxml2_xzclose((xzFile) context) == LZMA_OK ) ? 0 : -1; ^ 1 error generated. The solution for this is a little more subtle and can be fixed in a couple of ways. When using Homebrew, there are several libraries that use a formula called xz (including the_silver_searcher and imagemagick ), which by default install a version of liblzma that is incompatible with most Ruby builds. (Homebrew installs only the 64-bit version of the library, but most Ruby builds are universal.) This can be fixed in a couple of ways: a. The most reliable way appears to be temporarily unlinking xz and relinking it during an install of nokogiri : ```sh brew unlink xz gem install nokogiri # or bundle install brew link xz ``` b. The third way is to use a Homebrew-installed libxml2 , as suggested in using your system libraries . ```sh brew install libxml2 # If installing directly gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries \\ --with-xml2-include=$(brew --prefix libxml2)/include/libxml2 # If using Bundle bundle config build.nokogiri --use-system-libraries \\ --with-xml2-include=$(brew --prefix libxml2)/include/libxml2 bundle install ``` When working with this, be certain to use `$(brew --prefix libxml2)` because it will use the correct location for your Homebrew install. Unable to find libraries on macOS Mojave \u00b6 Xcode 10 on macOS Mojave moves the system headers out of /usr/include and so Nokogiri will fail to build. Instead you'll see an error similar to this: Building nokogiri using packaged libraries. ----- libiconv is missing. please visit http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html for help with installing dependencies. ----- *** extconf.rb failed *** Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary libraries and/or headers. A temporary workaround to allow previous releases of Nokogiri to build is to install the extra headers package mentioned in the Xcode 10 release notes: open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg You can also install the headers package from the command line (e.g. for a build script or a CI server): sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target / Other macOS Tips \u00b6 Make sure ruby is compiled with the latest clang compiler. Binary gems and ruby should be compiled with the same compiler/environment. If you have multiple versions of Xcode installed, make sure you use the right xcode-select . Try installing with system libraries . If reporting an issue about the macOS installation instructions, please mention @zenspider. Install with system libraries \u00b6 Nokogiri will refuse to build against certain versions of libxml2 , libxslt supplied with your operating system, and certain versions will cause mysterious problems. The compile scripts will warn you if you try to do this. Step 1: Install pkg-config \u00b6 On Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install pkg-config On FreeBSD: sudo pkg install pkgconf Step 2: Build Nokogiri \u00b6 Using gem: gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries Or, use Bundler: bundle config build.nokogiri --use-system-libraries bundle install Install with custom / non-standard libraries \u00b6 If: you've got libxml2 and/or libxslt installed in a nonstandard place, and you don't have pkg-config installed you can use command-line parameters to the gem install command to specify build parameters. If you've got the proper config scripts: gem install nokogiri -- \\ --use-system-libraries \\ --with-xml2-config = /path/to/xml2-config \\ --with-xslt-config = /path/to/xslt-config or, you can specify the installation root directory: gem install nokogiri -- \\ --use-system-libraries \\ --with-xml2-dir = /path/to/dir \\ --with-xslt-dir = /path/to/dir or, you can specify include and library directories separately: gem install nokogiri -- \\ --use-system-libraries \\ --with-xml2-lib = /path/to/builds/lib \\ --with-xml2-include = /path/to/builds/include/libxml2 \\ --with-xslt-lib = /path/to/builds/lib \\ --with-xslt-include = /path/to/builds/include Note: By default, libxslt header files are installed into the root include directory, but libxml2 header files are installed into a subdirectory thereof named libxml2 . It's likely that you'll also need to specify the location of your zlib and iconv (and possibly exslt ) install directories as well. In that case, you can add the options: gem install nokogiri -- \\ --use-system-libraries \\ # ... --with-iconv-dir = /path/to/dir \\ --with-zlib-dir = /path/to/dir \\ [ --with-exslt-dir = /path/to/dir ] [ --with-exslt-config = /path/to/exslt-config ] How to tell Bundler to use custom parameters \u00b6 bundle config build.nokogiri \\ --use-system-libraries \\ --with-xml2-lib=/usr/local/lib \\ --with-xml2-include=/usr/local/include/libxml2/libxml \\ --with-xslt-lib=/usr/local/lib \\ --with-xslt-include=/usr/local/include/libxslt \\ --with-iconv-lib=/usr/local/lib \\ --with-iconv-include=/usr/local/include Do not attempt Bundler installation using Bundler versions before v1.8.3. See bundler/bundler#3053 . But if you really want to, see earlier git history of this file, which includes a workaround. Ruby on Alpine Linux (Docker) \u00b6 To compile against Alpine's own XML libraries, add the necessary development tools and libraries to the image. FROM ruby:2.6-alpine RUN apk add --no-cache build-base libxml2-dev libxslt-dev RUN gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries When optimizing the size of an Alpine image, the runtime libraries must be permanently added. Additionally, adding and removing development tooling can be chained with gem installation to ensure a small layer. FROM ruby:2.6-alpine RUN apk add --no-cache libxml2 libxslt && \\ apk add --no-cache --virtual .gem-installdeps build-base libxml2-dev libxslt-dev && \\ gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries && \\ rm -rf $GEM_HOME /cache && \\ apk del .gem-installdeps This approach nets an 12.1 MB layer (versus 18.1 MB without --use-system-libraries ) and saves over 170 MB in build tools. SmartOS (Nonstandard) \u00b6 SmartOS installation requires building and using libxml2/libxslt/libiconv in a nonstandard location. Building on the previous section, here's how to do it: (Note: pkgsrc is included in JPC SmartOS instances) pkgin install ruby gcc49 libxml2 libxslt zlib libiconv ruby22-rake gmake ln -s /opt/local/gcc49/bin/gcc /opt/local/bin/gcc gem install nokogiri -- \\ --use-system-libraries \\ --with-xml2-lib = /opt/local/lib \\ --with-xml2-include = /opt/local/include/libxml2 \\ --with-xslt-lib = /opt/local/lib \\ --with-xslt-include = /opt/local/include/libxslt \\ --with-iconv-lib = /opt/local/lib \\ --with-iconv-include = /opt/local/include \\ --with-zlib-dir = /opt/local/lib See the previous section for guidance on how to instruct Bundler to use these options.","title":"Installing Nokogiri"},{"location":"tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html#installing-nokogiri","text":"Nokogiri includes its own updated and patched copies of libxml2 and libxslt libraries.

The solution for this is a little more subtle and can be fixed in a couple of ways. When using Homebrew, there are several libraries that use a formula called xz (including the_silver_searcher and imagemagick ), which by default install a version of liblzma that is incompatible with most Ruby builds. (Homebrew installs only the 64-bit version of the library, but most Ruby builds are universal.) This can be fixed in a couple of ways: a. The most reliable way appears to be temporarily unlinking xz and relinking it during an install of nokogiri : ```sh brew unlink xz gem install nokogiri # or bundle install brew link xz ``` b. The third way is to use a Homebrew-installed libxml2 , as suggested in using your system libraries . ```sh brew install libxml2 # If installing directly gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries \\ --with-xml2-include=$(brew --prefix libxml2)/include/libxml2 # If using Bundle bundle config build.nokogiri --use-system-libraries \\ --with-xml2-include=$(brew --prefix libxml2)/include/libxml2 bundle install ``` When working with this, be certain to use `$(brew --prefix libxml2)` because it will use the correct location for your Homebrew install.","title":"Error Message About Undeclared Identifier LZMA_OK"},{"location":"tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html#unable-to-find-libraries-on-macos-mojave","text":"Xcode 10 on macOS Mojave moves the system headers out of /usr/include and so Nokogiri will fail to build.

XML ( '<foo><bar /><foo>' , nil , 'EUC-JP' )","title":"Encoding"},{"location":"tutorials/searching_a_xml_html_document.html","text":"Searching an HTML / XML Document \u00b6 Basic Searching \u00b6 Let's suppose you have the following document: [shows.xml] <root> <sitcoms> <sitcom> <name> Married with Children </name> <characters> <character> Al Bundy </character> <character> Bud Bundy </character> <character> Marcy Darcy </character> </characters> </sitcom> <sitcom> <name> Perfect Strangers </name> <characters> <character> Larry Appleton </character> <character> Balki Bartokomous </character> </characters> </sitcom> </sitcoms> <dramas> <drama> <name> The A-Team </name> <characters> <character> John \"Hannibal\" Smith </character> <character> Templeton \"Face\" Peck </character> <character> \"B.A.\" Baracus </character> <character> \"Howling Mad\" Murdock </character> </characters> </drama> </dramas> </root> Let's further suppose that you want a list of all the characters in all the shows in this document. @doc = Nokogiri :: XML ( File . open ( \"shows.xml\" )) @doc . xpath ( \"//character\" ) # => [\"<character>Al Bundy</character>\", # \"<character>Bud Bundy</character>\", # \"<character>Marcy Darcy</character>\", # \"<character>Larry Appleton</character>\", # \"<character>Balki Bartokomous</character>\", # \"<character>John \\\"Hannibal\\\" Smith</character>\", # \"<character>Templeton \\\"Face\\\" Peck</character>\", # \"<character>\\\"B.A.\\\" Baracus</character>\", # \"<character>\\\"Howling Mad\\\" Murdock</character>\"] The Node methods xpath and css actually return a NodeSet , which acts very much like an array, and contains matching nodes from the document. characters = @doc . xpath ( \"//character\" ) characters [ 0 ]. to_s # => \"<character>Al Bundy</character>\" You can use any XPath or CSS query you like (see the chapter on XPath and CSS syntax for more information). @doc . xpath ( \"//dramas//character\" ) # => [\"<character>John \\\"Hannibal\\\" Smith</character>\", # \"<character>Templeton \\\"Face\\\" Peck</character>\", # \"<character>\\\"B.A.\\\" Baracus</character>\", # \"<character>\\\"Howling Mad\\\" Murdock</character>\"] Notably, you can even use CSS queries in an XML document! characters = @doc . css ( \"sitcoms name\" ) # => [\"<name>Married with Children</name>\", \"<name>Perfect Strangers</name>\"] CSS queries are often the easiest and most succinct way to express what you're looking for, so don't be afraid to use them! Single Results \u00b6 If you know you're going to get only a single result back, you can use the shortcuts at_css and at_xpath instead of having to access the first element of a NodeSet. @doc . css ( \"dramas name\" ) . first # => \"<name>The A-Team</name>\" @doc . at_css ( \"dramas name\" ) # => \"<name>The A-Team</name>\" Namespaces \u00b6 Just like our Ruby code, XML can suffer from name collisions. For example, an autoparts dealer can sell tires and so can a bike dealer. Both of them may use a \"tire\" tag to describe the tires they sell. However, we need to be able to tell the difference between a car tire and a bike tire . This is where namespaces come to the rescue. Namespaces associate tags with a unique URL. Let's take a look at the autoparts store's XML versus the bike stores: [parts.xml] <parts> <!-- Alice's Auto Parts Store --> <inventory xmlns= \"http://alicesautoparts.com/\" > <tire> all weather </tire> <tire> studded </tire> <tire> extra wide </tire> </inventory> <!-- Bob's Bike Shop --> <inventory xmlns= \"http://bobsbikes.com/\" > <tire> street </tire> <tire> mountain </tire> </inventory> </parts> Since the URLs are unique, we can associate our query with a URL and get only the tires belonging to that url: @doc = Nokogiri :: XML ( File . read ( \"parts.xml\" )) car_tires = @doc . xpath ( '//car:tire' , 'car' => 'http://alicesautoparts.com/' ) # => [\"<tire>all weather</tire>\", # \"<tire>studded</tire>\", # \"<tire>extra wide</tire>\"] bike_tires = @doc . xpath ( '//bike:tire' , 'bike' => 'http://bobsbikes.com/' ) # => [\"<tire>street</tire>\", \"<tire>mountain</tire>\"] To make this namespace registration a bit easier, nokogiri will automatically register any namespaces it finds on the root node for you . Nokogiri will associate the name in the declaration with the supplied URL. If we stick to this naming convention, we can shorten up our code. Let's take this atom feed for example: [atom.xml] <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <feed xmlns= \"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" > <title> Example Feed </title> <link href= \"http://example.org/\" /> <updated> 2003-12-13T18:30:02Z </updated> <author> <name> John Doe </name> </author> <id> urn:uuid:60a76c80-d399-11d9-b93C-0003939e0af6 </id> <entry> <title> Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok </title> <link href= \"http://example.org/2003/12/13/atom03\" /> <id> urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a </id> <updated> 2003-12-13T18:30:02Z </updated> <summary> Some text. </summary> </entry> </feed> If we stick to the convention, we can grab all title tags like this @doc . xpath ( '//xmlns:title' ) # => [\"<title>Example Feed</title>\", \"<title>Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok</title>\"] Don't be fooled though. You do not have to use XPath to get the benefits of namespaces. CSS selectors can be used as well. CSS just uses the pipe symbol to indicate a namespace search. Let's see the previous search rewritten to use CSS: @doc . css ( 'xmlns|title' ) # => [\"<title>Example Feed</title>\", \"<title>Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok</title>\"] When using CSS, if the namespace is called \"xmlns\", you can even omit the namespace name. That means your CSS will reduce to: @doc . css ( 'title' ) # => [\"<title>Example Feed</title>\", \"<title>Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok</title>\"] Dealing with namespaces is a broad topic. If you need more examples, be sure to check out this blog post or send an email to the mailing list , and we can help out. But I'm Lazy and Don't Want to Deal With Namespaces! \u00b6 Lazy == Efficient, so no judgements. :) If you have an XML document with namespaces, but would prefer to ignore them entirely (and query as if Tim Bray had never invented them), then you can call remove_namespaces! on an XML::Document to remove all namespaces. Of course, if the document had nodes with the same names but different namespaces, they will now be ambiguous. But you're lazy! You don't care! Slop 1 \u00b6 Maybe you want a more interactive (read: sloppy) way to access nodes and attributes. If you like what XmlSimple does, then you'll probably like Nokogiri's Slop mode. 2 Slop mode allows you to violate the Law of Demeter with extreme prejudice, by using #method_missing to introspect on a node's child tags. 3 doc = Nokogiri :: Slop <<- EOXML <employees> <employee status=\"active\"> <fullname>Dean Martin</fullname> </employee> <employee status=\"inactive\"> <fullname>Jerry Lewis</fullname> </employee> </employees> EOXML # navigate! doc . employees . employee . last . fullname . content # => \"Jerry Lewis\" # access node attributes! doc . employees . employee . first [ \"status\" ] # => \"active\" # use some xpath! doc . employees . employee ( \"[@status='active']\" ) . fullname . content # => \"Dean Martin\" doc . employees . employee ( :xpath => \"@status='active'\" ) . fullname . content # => \"Dean Martin\" # use some css! doc . employees . employee ( \"[status='active']\" ) . fullname . content # => \"Dean Martin\" doc . employees . employee ( :css => \"[status='active']\" ) . fullname . content # => \"Dean Martin\" Aww yeah.

That's the power of the slop . 4 Don't use this. \u21a9 This may or may not be a backhanded compliment. \u21a9 No, really, don't use this.
